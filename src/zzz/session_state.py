class SessionState:
    """
    Typed encapsulation of the app's session-stored state.

    Django's session is a loosely-typed key/value store. This class is the
    single, well-typed view over it: each piece of per-user, cross-request
    state is a declared field, parsed (and coerced/validated) from the session
    in ``from_session()`` and written back in ``to_session()``. Views and
    templates read ``request.session_state`` -- attached to every request by
    ``SessionStateMiddleware`` (see zzz/middleware.py) -- instead of poking at
    ``request.session`` directly, so every key's shape and default lives here.

    It starts empty; add state as the project needs it. The pattern per field:

        1. Declare a typed field with a default on the dataclass:
               example_id : int = None

        2. Parse + coerce it in ``from_session()`` (always with a safe fallback):
               try:
                   example_id = int( request.session.get('example_id') )
               except ( TypeError, ValueError ):
                   example_id = None
               return SessionState( example_id = example_id )

        3. Serialize it back in ``to_session()``:
               request.session['example_id'] = self.example_id

    Values that must also be visible to JavaScript belong in ClientConfig /
    AppConst (see zzz/environment), not read from the session client-side.
