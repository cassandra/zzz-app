"""
Utilities for testing async tasks and event loops.

This module provides cleanup utilities for Django tests that create
background event loops or async tasks, preventing test hangs.

Note: This is separate from AJAX/async request testing in view_test_base.py.
This module focuses on asyncio event loops and background tasks.
